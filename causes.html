<p style="font-size:40px;font-family:Impact;">The causes of homework</p>
<p style="font-size:27px;font-family:Courier New;">All this homework stress, was causing students to feel something. Researchers begin to investigate, interview. Many researchers found out that students were feeling something that isn’t healthy. They were feeling some symptoms. Such as headaches, exhaustion, sleep deprivation, weight loss, and stomach problems. If you really think about it, that’s something that school shouldn't be making you feel like that. As I said on the last page, they researchers discovered that students will usually spend three to four hours a night doing homework. Students have to wake up early, get ready and also leave early to make it on time to school. Then they have lots of classwork and knowing that you have to go home and do homework. That’s just a lot of pressure. Also, if students have activities, clubs, or sports and having homework, that just isn’t good.</p>
