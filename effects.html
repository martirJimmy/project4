<p style="font-size:40px;font-family:Impact;">Cause and Effect</p>
<p style="font-size:27px;font-family:Courier New;">After describing all the reasoning and causes, it also has effects. With all the homework stress, it actually affected them. Students no longer attended their activities, clubs, and sports. Some even say they hardly even see their family or do their hobbies. It also stopped the students to meet their development skills or critical life skills. A survey was giving out about all these symptoms and their effects about homework. The researchers say at least 80 percent of the students feel at least one symptom. But 44 percent also say they feel at least three or more symptoms. By symptom, I just don’t mean headaches and stressed. I’m talking about everything I said so far. The students felt pressured to work like exactly adults Other researchers also say some students actually do drugs or drink to help out the stress. But the most important is most kids are feeling burned out before college. They say school, homework, outside activities, sleep, and repeat. </p>
