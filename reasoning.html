<p style="font-size:40px;font-family:Impact;">Research</p>
<p style="font-size:27px;font-family:Courier New;">Based on some research I did, there was a lot of studies and complains from all over the world of homework stress. Many therapist have been saying most of their cilients have been saying they are stressed and weared out due to homework. This was over extending and a concern to a lot of people. so many health studies decided to see if homework is a big deal. This concern was starting to become a big deal because it was also making kids sick. The researchers who researched on students noticed that they are given a lot more homework that they should be recieving. They say students usually stay up all night doing three or fours worth of homeowork. They say they have to wake up early to be at school on time by getting dressed, eating, and traffic. Then they have to do school work. The students with activities or clubs that's out of school is no longer attended. </p>
